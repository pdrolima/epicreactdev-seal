# Lifting state

## 📝 Your Notes

I've learned  `lift state up` and `colocate state`

`lift state up` is a way to move state up to their closet common ancestor,
when they're reflecting the same changing data. For example:

The component `App` has a input for the Name, and another input for the Age, and we have another
component `Display` that is used to display this data. With that in mind, we can see that,
we need to manage the state of `Age` inside our `App` component, which is currently being managed
by the `Age` component itself. So we lift the state of `Age` up to the `App` component.

More info can be found at  [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

`colocate state`  can lead us to increase the maintainability of our code, as well as prevent
performance issues by preventing unnecessary re-renderings, and that I should try to keep the state as close to where is relevant as possible.

This concept, is basically do the opposite of `lift state up`.  Imagine if we don't want to display
the user age anymore at the `Display` component, we colocate the state of `Age` inside the `Age`.

## Background

A common question from React beginners is how to share state between two sibling
components. The answer is to
["lift the state"](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) which
basically amounts to finding the lowest common parent shared between the two
components and placing the state management there, and then passing the state
and a mechanism for updating that state down into the components that need it.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/03.js)
- [Final](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.js)

👨‍💼 Peter told us we've got a new feature request for the `Display` component. He
wants us to display the `animal` the user selects. But that state is managed in
a "sibling" component, so we have to move that management to the least common
parent (`App`) and then pass it down.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 colocating state

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.js)

As a community we’re pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
One thing that we typically have trouble remembering to do is to push state back
down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

👨‍💼 Peter told us that now users only want the animal displayed instead of the
name:

```javascript
function Display({animal}) {
  return <div>{`Your favorite animal is: ${animal}!`}</div>
}
```

You'll notice that just updating the `Display` component to this works fine, but
for the extra credit, go through the process of moving state to the components
that need it. You know what you just did for the `Animal` component? You need to
do the opposite thing for the `Name` component.
