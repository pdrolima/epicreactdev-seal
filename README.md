If BUD/S can go through the Hell Week, then I can focus o review React focused for 2 days. Right?

**Advice from a Navy SEAL**:
Rather than focus on the size of the task, focus on the immediate. What do you have to do right now? Don’t pull future pain forward. Don’t let your mind wander towards the horizon, thinking of all the hard things still to come.
Focus on the now. When faced with a challenge or disruption, shorten your time horizon by concentrating on your immediate tasks at hand. You will do what must be done and ultimately keep moving forward.

Get up, be wet and sandy, and stay in the fight.
